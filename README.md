Digital Modulation
Modulation is a fundamental process in communication systems that enables the transmission of
information or data over long distances. The original data (message signal) is often too weak to
be transmitted directly through a channel. To address this, it is combined with a high-frequency,
strong signal called the carrier signal, which acts as a medium to carry the message signal, such as
sound, images, or data.
Modulation is essential in various applications, including radio broadcasting, television, mobile
networks, and satellite communications. It is broadly classified into two types based on the nature
of the message signal: analog modulation and digital modulation.
In digital modulation, there are four primary techniques:
1. Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)
2. Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)
3. Phase Shift Keying (PSK)
4. Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)
